*_Case study_*: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488343[Bug 488343].

== Get the custom .setup

Open https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488343[Bug 488343]; check the
related https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/75884/[Gerrit change], and download the
zip containing the setup file.

Extract the archive, locate the Oomph .setup file, and launch Oomph

== Run Oomph

Launch the Eclipse Installer
.footnote:[You should download and install the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer[Oomph installer]]
, and then switch to advanced mode.

In the next page you can select the base eclipse, to use for development.
Choose _Eclipse for RCP and RAP_. Plus, you're suggested to use the 64bit version,
to avoid memory limitation issues.

In the Next page you choose which projects you will contribute to.

== Use custom .setup

Currently, the JSDT .setup model is not in the Oomph public catalog.
To use the setup, drag and drop the .setup file into the _User_ folder.

Then, under _User_, you can see the _WTP_ subtree. Identify the _JSDT_
node; check its checkbox and verify the project is added.

Now press _Next_, and proceed to the variables page.

== Setup variables and install
Check the _Show all variables_ checkbox,
so you can check and configure the parameters for your installation, e.g.:
_installation location_, _git rules_, _Gerrit repo_, _Eclipse userid_ etc..

In the next page press _Finish_ to start downloading and installing the bundles.
The download is fast, as with the bundle pool, Oomph never downloads the same bundle twice.

While Oomph is completing the install, you will see the new instance of Eclipse
popping up, and completing the setup tasks, including getting bundles, and
fetching source code from Git/Gerrit.

== First run of your new IDE

When the setup is complete, close the welcome window.
In the workspace you will see the list of JSDT projects, cloned from Git/Gerrit.

Look in the error log, where you can see errors related to a missing API Baseline.
Fix this in _Preferences > Plug-in Development > API Baseline_, by adding an
existing Eclipse Neon installation directory as target Baseline.

After this you're ready to launch an Eclipse product.

== Launch Target Configuration

Open Run.. > Run Configuration and create a new Eclipse Application configuration.
Switch to the Plug-ins tab, and select to launch with _Plug-ins selected below only_
.footnote:[this give fine control in adding/removing plug-ins from the configuration.]

After this, remove the _*test*_ plug-ins in the workspace from the launch configuration;
de-select the _Include optional dependencies..._ checkbox;
click the _Add Required Plug-ins_ button and, Finally, _Run_ the launch configuration.

== Run and Check the Target application

Now the target application is running, we can check that contains all the JSDT features
The easy way to check this, is creating a javascript project.

*_Update_* : If you see some issue in running the target application,
this means there are some adjustments we need to do to the setup file.

== Conclusions

Creating an Oomph .setup is initially hard. But if the team manage to have a
good setup, this will make easier to new developers to contribute.

Indeed, using an Oomph setup is pretty easy, since the first time you're using it.
It just take a little time to get used to concepts like _bundle pools_; _.setup files_;
_user variables_; and after a couple of runs, it is actually easier to use it
rather than explaining how it works.

Many thanks to _Esteban Dugueperoux_, who contributed the initial setup,
and to all the other Contributors and doc writers, who are making Eclipse better.

Hope you enjoyed this walkthrough. Soon I'm going to make this document available
under EPL both on the JSDT website and on my personal blog.
