QuickStart

== Prepare your IDE

Get Latest Eclipse Modeling, which already contains EMF Forms.

To install EMF Forms in your custom Eclipse, open _Help -> Install New Software_;
select the latest update site from https://www.eclipse.org/ecp/emfforms/download.html[here],
e.g.: http://download.eclipse.org/ecp/releases/releases_19/; add the update site;
and install the _ECP SDK_ Feature.
As an example, below you see the feature content for v.1.9

== Create a Model

Create an _Empty EMF Project_ with the name _org.eclipse.example.bowlingmodel_.
Select the model folder, add a new _Ecore Model_, named _bowling.ecore_.
Open the _.ecore_ model with the model editor.

Double click on the root node of the _.ecore_ model, to open Properties.
Select the empty root node, name it *bowling*; then set the NS prefix to
*org.eclipse.example.bowling*, and the NS URI to *+++http://org/eclipse/example/bowling+++*.

Add to the class an attribute called _name_, of type _EString_;

Add to the class an attribute called _name_, of type _EString_;
and a new reference named _players_ with EType _Player_;
