= JFace basics
Patrik Suzzi <psuzzi@gmail.com>

== About JFace
JFace operates on top of SWT, providing classes and interfaces to handle many of the common task, so the developer can focus on user interface.

=== Purpose
This doc is a quick reference on how I use JFace, starting from a simple empty window, showing a simple dialog, and finally putting a list and a textbox to use as filter. 


== Base example
Simple way to launch a SWT Shell


	/** simple wayt to open shell */
	static void openShell(){
		Display display = new Display();
		Shell shell = new Shell(display);
		//
		shell.setText("Simple SWT Shell");
		//
		
		shell.open();
		// eventloop
		while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
			if(!display.readAndDispatch()){
				// no more entries in event queue
				display.sleep();
			}
		}
		display.dispose();
	}


Base example to launch a Composite with JFace components.
